            COVID-19 Temporary Outdoor Dining

        <div class="section-body">
            The City of Huntington Park is offering food businesses an opportunity to continue providing
            dine-in services safely by establishing temporary outdoor dining guidelines. Business owners of
            “low-risk businesses” may now apply for a Temporary Outdoor Dining Permit to extend dine-in
            service areas to outside areas. Under the temporary outdoor dining guidelines, the allowed areas
            are a private parking lot (private property) or public right-of-way (i.e.. sidewalk).
            <br>
            <br>
            The business must follow the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health’s Protocol for
            Restaurants Opening for On-Site Dining: Appendix I once the permit has been acquired.
            Infection Control and physical distancing requirements shall be in place at all times during
            business hours of operation.
